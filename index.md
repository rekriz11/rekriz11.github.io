I am a Postdoctoral Reasearch Fellow at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, working with Chris Callison-Burch.

Over time, human knowledge has mostly been expressed in text, some of which are unstructured.
To make sense of these knowledge and understand the nuances of human language, computers
have to be able to extract structured knowledge from unstructured text. 

My research interest focuses on applying machine learning to better understand the various ways
in which words, phrases, and sentences are expressed.
